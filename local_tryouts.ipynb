I used [sklearn-imbalanced](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn) for random over/under-samplings. However, application of basic classes oversampling creates too much data. The most represented class has 4875 images, thus random oversampling can generate about `4875 * 403 = 1964625` images. I tested such approach in the very beginning.\n",

    "Another approach is to undersample most common classes to a certain number and than oversample rare classes. Such approach gives less images to train on comparing to the previous approach. The difficulty here is to undersample correctly most common classes. A solution can be to cluster by color images from a single class and pick a balanced number of each cluster representatives to form. Unfortunately, such approach requires to handle data directly, without using provided `gen_builder` and this is forbidden by organizers. The code of this approach can be found [here](notebooks/balanced_dataflow.ipynb). There is still a solution to choose images randomly in the undersampling phase. Here is a code using `sklearn-imbalanced` to create generators with under+oversampled balanced data:\n",
