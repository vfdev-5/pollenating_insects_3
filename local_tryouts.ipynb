    "As we see from the tutorial notebook classes are not equally represented, there are even classes with only 4 images.  It will be very difficult to train a network to predict correctly such classes. For more info on data see [this notebook](notebooks/data_visualization.ipynb)\n",

    "#### Class weights \n",
    "\n",
    "A basic solution that can be done is to add `class_weights` to keras. I did that in the following manner: \n",
    "- compute class count from training data generator\n",
    "- define weights as \n",
    "```\n",
    "class_weights[class_index] = np.log(1.0 + (max_count / class_weights[class_index])**2)\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Random over/under-sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an option to oversample training dataset using non-trivial data augmentations. I used [sklearn-imbalanced](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn) for random over/under-samplings. However, application of basic classes oversampling creates too much data. The most represented class has 4875 images, thus random oversampling can generate about `4875 * 403 = 1964625` images. I tested such approach in the very beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to undersample most common classes to a certain number and than oversample rare classes. Such approach gives less images to train on comparing to the previous approach. The difficulty here is to undersample correctly most common classes. A solution can be to cluster by color images from a single class and pick a balanced number of each cluster representatives to form. Unfortunately, such approach requires to handle data directly, without using provided `gen_builder` and this is forbidden by organizers. The code of this approach can be found [here](notebooks/balanced_dataflow.ipynb). There is still a solution to choose images randomly in the undersampling phase. Here is a code using `sklearn-imbalanced` to create generators with under+oversampled balanced data:\n",
